# Code Quality Requirements

**MANDATORY for all code changes:**

1. **Compilation Check**: Always run `cargo check` before submitting any code changes to ensure compilation succeeds
2. **Code Formatting**: Always run `cargo fmt` on all modified files to maintain consistent code style

These checks are required for every code modification, no exceptions.
